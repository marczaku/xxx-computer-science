## Algorithms & Data

Data
- Passive part of a computer program
- Can be constant or a variable

Algorithms
- Sequence of instructions
- Works on data
- Active part of a program
- Usually constant

## IPO Model
- Input
- Processing
- Output

Basis of every algorithm / program
- Input: Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad, Network, …
- Output: Screen, Speakers, Printer, Network, Files…

Earlier: Programs were mechanically written
- By melding transistors in a certain way

Later: Programs are stored in memory
  - Like „normal“ data
  - Control Unit
    - interpret commands
    - configures input / output

## Hardware
- CPU
- GPU
- RAM (Memory)
- Hard Drive

## Operating System
- Manages Hardware and Software on computer
- File Management
- Memory Management
- Process Management
- Handling Input, Output
- Controlling Peripheral Devices
