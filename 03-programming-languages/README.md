# Programming Languages

## Generations
- Machine Code
- Assembly
- High-Level Languages
  - imperative, object-oriented languages
- 4th Generation Language
  - e.g. database languages like SQL
- 5th Generation Languages
  - declarative languages, expert systems

## Machine Code
- Binary Encoded Commands
- Directly executed on CPU
  - interpretation of commands cast in silicon
  - commands often map directly to circuits
- Very primitive commands
  - binary logic operations
  - memory manipulation

## Assembly
- Instead of Binary Commands
- Textual abbreviations (Mnemonics)
- One Assembly Command = One Machine Code Instruction
  - No new features
  - Only more readable/convenient
- Assembler
  - translates Assembly Code to Machine Code
  - "assembles" the program

## High-Level Languages
- Adds abstract concepts to simplify programming
  - variables, functios, flow-controls, classes, templates, ...
- Either Compiler
  - translates program code into machine code
  - often considered programming languages
  - e.g. C++
- Or Interpreter
  - interprets code directly during runtime (while being executed)
  - often considered scripting languages
  - e.g. Python
- Or Both (Hybrid)
  - Compiler compiles into cross-platform IL code
  - Interpreter translates IL code to CPU instructions during runtime
  - e.g. C#

## Programming Paradigms
- structured programming
  - using functions
  - separation of data and functions
- object-oriented programming
  - unity of functions and data on classes and objects
- functional programming languages
  - function-centered without global or shared state
